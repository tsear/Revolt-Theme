        <h3 class="manifesto-header">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="manifesto-text">Revolt Strategies started from a simple observation: too much of this industry is designed to keep clients dependent. Agencies promise strategy but deliver the minimum. Platforms raise costs when engagement dips, turn SEO into a treadmill, and make it harder for anyone without deep pockets to compete. The deck is stacked.</p>

      <div class="manifesto-section">
        <h3 class="manifesto-header">The Solution</h3>
        <p class="manifesto-text">Revolt is my answer. I build in the open—no tricks, no lock-ins, no hidden levers. Because everyone deserves a real presence online. Whether you're an artist, a nonprofit, or just someone with something to say, your domain is your ground. Own it. Grow it. Don't rent it from someone else's algorithm.</p>

        <p class="bridge-text">This timeline shows how that philosophy became reality—commit by commit, feature by feature.</p>
